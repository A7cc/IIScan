# One About IIS_scan

My idea for this tool is to collect all the vulnerabilities in IIS. Currently, I have only implemented the short file leakage vulnerability in IIS, and I will add other vulnerabilities in IIS when I have time in the future.

# Two Usage

```bash
IISscan -u target [-c true/flase]
```

# Three Todo

- Other vulnerabilities in IIS
- High concurrency
- multiple target
- 。。。。
